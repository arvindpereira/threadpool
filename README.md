# threadpool
Fork of a nice threadpool library written by Ronald Kriemann which can be found here: http://www.kriemann.name/Ronald/projects/threadpool/index.en.html#threadpool

Documentation for the library can be found here:
http://www.kriemann.name/Ronald/projects/threadpool/thrpool.pdf

The only thing I will add is that if you wish to build a shared library version of this library on either OSX or Linux,
the Makefile will now build one for you through my additions.

For information on how to link to the shared library and use it in your own code, look at the Makefile in the Test directory.
